## Code of Conduct

Tree-act has adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) as its Code of Conduct, and we expect project participants to adhere it. Please read the [full text](https://github.com/caucse-hercules/Tree-acT/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) so that you can understand what action will and will not be tolerated.

## Open Development

All work on Tree-acT happens directly on [GitHub](https://github.com/caucse-hercules/Tree-acT). Until now, core team pushed directly to main repository for MVP(Minimum Viable Product) development and merged to main branch, but from now on, both core team members and external contributors send pull requests from feature branch to develop branch which go through the same review process. And core team reviews pull request, merge pull request to develop branch.

## Branch Organization

We are following [git-flow](https://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/index.html) methodology. So, if you want to develop new feature, your branch name should be something like `feature/<your-feature-or-function>`. And after your development is done, you could send pull request from your feature branch to our origin(to you, upstream) develop branch so that your feature is merged to our develop branch.

## License

By contributing to Tree-acT, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under its MIT license.
